 <h2>what is an endorphant?</h2>

 <p>like a heirophant, but for endorphins. i show you ways to find good things inside yourself.</p>
 <p><i>alternatively, the internal elephant.</i> &#x1f418;</p>
 <p>my interests include being excited, making up stories out of things that
 don't seem like they should be stories, personifying non-persons.</p> 
 <p>i am still learning about everything and i hope that never changes.</p>

   <h5>8 january 2015</h5>
   <p>i learned about twine macros! and by that, i mean i stared at other people's twine macros and had a lot of trial and error until i managed to kludge together something that had the behavior i wanted. i already have a vaguely passable knowledgebase for general coding skills, so it's mostly syntax grokking here. i'm fairly confident that any action i can think of, i should be able to figure out.</p>
   <p>today's victory was adding some custom css to my part of the tildetwine, and also a feature that lets you get rid of items in your inventory. i implemented this by giving the player a hole over an icy river into which objects can be 'dropped', which removes it from the inventory. <a href="http://tilde.town/~jumblesale/twine/#.0$Iml0ZW1zIg==,eyJnb2xkIjowLCJjcm93YmFyIjp0cnVlfQ==$ImV2ZW50cyI=,e30=$InN0YXRzIg==,eyJoZWFsdGgiOjEwLCJoZWFsdGhfbWF4IjoxMCwibWFuYSI6NSwibWFuYV9tYXgiOjV9$InNraWxscyI=,eyJhZHZlbnR1cmluZyI6MX0=.6$Iml0ZW1zIg==,eyJnb2xkIjowLCJjcm93YmFyIjp0cnVlfQ==$ImV2ZW50cyI=,e30=$InN0YXRzIg==,eyJoZWFsdGgiOjEwLCJoZWFsdGhfbWF4IjoxMCwibWFuYSI6NSwibWFuYV9tYXgiOjV9$InNraWxscyI=,eyJhZHZlbnR1cmluZyI6MX0=.7$Iml0ZW1zIg==,eyJnb2xkIjowLCJjcm93YmFyIjp0cnVlfQ==$ImV2ZW50cyI=,e30=$InN0YXRzIg==,eyJoZWFsdGgiOjEwLCJoZWFsdGhfbWF4IjoxMCwibWFuYSI6NSwibWFuYV9tYXgiOjV9$InNraWxscyI=,eyJhZHZlbnR1cmluZyI6MX0=.a$Iml0ZW1zIg==,eyJnb2xkIjowLCJjcm93YmFyIjp0cnVlfQ==$ImV2ZW50cyI=,e30=$InN0YXRzIg==,eyJoZWFsdGgiOjEwLCJoZWFsdGhfbWF4IjoxMCwibWFuYSI6NSwibWFuYV9tYXgiOjV9$InNraWxscyI=,eyJhZHZlbnR1cmluZyI6MX0=.b$Iml0ZW1zIg==,eyJnb2xkIjowLCJjcm93YmFyIjp0cnVlfQ==$ImV2ZW50cyI=,e30=$InN0YXRzIg==,eyJoZWFsdGgiOjEwLCJoZWFsdGhfbWF4IjoxMCwibWFuYSI6NSwibWFuYV9tYXgiOjV9$InNraWxscyI=,eyJhZHZlbnR1cmluZyI6MX0=">here's a shortcut to that segment</a>. you can see the source for all of my tildetwine <a href="https://github.com/modgethanc/townie/tree/master/ttitt">here</a>.</p> 
   <p>the first thing i ever did in twine was to implement my own inventory system (the one in tildetwine is written by ~krowbar), and once i figured out how to add things to it, it became important to me for those things to be removable as well. the twine that came out of it was really just a sandbox to play around with those actions, but just those simple actions seem really compelling to me, for reasons i find hard to put into words. if you're interested in the result of that experiment, you can find it <a href="http://spray.no-leverage.com/if/qing.html">here</a>.</p>

   <p>friends, i am really excited about collaboration. i am even more excited about disorganized, incidental, and mysterious collaboration. this is the main draw of tildeverse for me.</p>
   <p>i like when things have just enough structure to create the idea of a context, but not enough structure to dictate exact terms of interaction. i like examining patterns of what people do and i like thinking about what sort of things can be built from those patterns that are greater than what anyone things is possible.</p>
   <p>i like when indirect actions are more meaningful than direct actions. <a href="nethackempire.html">nethack empire</a> is only the beginning of scratching this itch; i am slowly learning more about what this could become.</p>
   <p>i learned about the <a href="../~jumblesale/twine">tilde town twine</a> today, thanks to ~krowbar in irc earlier, and it is making my brain pace restlessly. i want to build a metaverse. of what verse it will be meta-ing, i am not yet sure.</p>
   <p>thanks for being here, everyone. thanks for being here and doing things and thinking about them.</p>

    <p>this was the first time i've had to write '2015'!</p>
    <p>when i was a younger endorphant, i spent a chunk of one of my summers having a fake unpaid internship to do a bunch of perl hacking in a city hundreds of miles away. mostly, i spent that time being mildly irresponsible with money, time, sleep, food, and drink. i learned a lot of things about myself, including how i didn't want to live my life in the long term.</p>
    <p>i bring this up now because i occasionally go back to those old haunts, benches along the rivers, public libraries, coffee shops i couldn't afford, and sit down with my headphonees pumping the soundtrack of my post-adolescent angst. i can do this with no regrets, and allow myself to be charmed by the fondness i have for these places. a lot of them have changed. most of them haven't. the energy is still in the dirt and the air and the bricks and the people, and i'm grateful that i can still tap into that channel, sit down, and get some <a href="https://github.com/modgethanc/tildescripts/commit/1ec8bddbed2a39a862986ab918ade5506847748e">perl hacking done<a>.</p>

   <p>thumbty0ing this on my phone keyboard after a long thirty hours of airports just because i can. did you know using vim with a soft keyboard is super tedious? it is. i am here to tell you that.</p>

    <p>i'm in an airport twiddling my thumbs right now, on my third rebooked flight. snow and ice are keeping planes out of the sky, and one of the ways i've been killing my time is playing 'air traffic controller', an unforgiving ascii game simulating the scheduling of planes taking off and landing at an airport. </p>
    <p>atc was written by ed james at uc berkeley in 1987. i'm still trying to wrap my head around the interface and conditions of success and failure, but it seems an apt game to play while watching airline gate agents attempt to juggle and untangle a nest of canceled flights and twitchy pasengers.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>i started messing with divs on this page with the intention of making something that displays nicer in a browser. however, i've been doing all of that exclusively on my laptop in extra conservative battery mode, which means i have not launched a graphical display. i'm browsing other tildes through lynx and noting how things render. these days, i'm only in text-only mode while traveling, and i forgot how quiet the internet gets when it's just text on a screen.</p>
    <p >it makes me not want to mess around much more with pretty graphical rendering. i'm in fact almost ready to dump html altogether and just make this a very well-organized text file.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>yeah, that didn't last. i got a little more antsy while waiting to board and started dumping some css into this file. there is something about slidyboxes that appeals to me. i aim to pack a maximal amount of information into one screen. given that i am currently on a 9" screen, it will be interesting to see how well this works on a larger monitor. but actually, mostly i am writing this for me, and mostly i am on this tinylaptop, so i don't really care.</p>

  <p>this is the first tildebox i'm on that i've really felt like rambling all over so i'm going to do that here.</p>
  <p>one of the things i like doing is to adopt th default page styling of whatever host i'm using. but soon i will be less lazy and eject an actual stylesheet so i can beat on things more. or maybe i won't and just make a massive index.html file. that's a thing, right?</p>
