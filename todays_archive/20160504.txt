i want to believe that it's possible for the human race to be united without
destroying individuality and freedom. i want to believe that it's possible for
humans to care for and respect each other without losing sight of themselves. i
want to believe that it's possible for humans to love themselves without being
selfish.

and yet some days i am starkly aware that we cannot have love without hate.

but we also cannot have hate without love.
