had sort of a weird day that felt like nothing really happened. i did some
cleaning and reorganizing in the pocket studio; i took a long walk through
campus; i talked to a few people. maybe i'm just feeling strange and dull
because this was the first day in a few weeks that i gave myself to step back
from work altogether and take a breather.

i'm really close to finishing up a bunch of stuff so i can get into having my
summer leave. i don't ever want to stop moving.

sometimes i'm tempted to dump a bunch of lines here about ttbp development, but
then i just started trying to keep a better changelog and commit messages. i'm
scribbling down little thoughts i have here and there while i'm working on
this, because i want to remember what working on this feels like. ~jumblesale
asked me about writing a piece for the zine, and i'd like to do that in the
near future once i hit all my goals for v1.0 release.

i started reading <i>the cuckoo's egg</i> by cliff stoll and it's pretty
fantastic. if you've read it, i'd love to gush about it to you! (i mean, i'd
love to do that anyway, but i don't like hyping/spoiling stuff for people, so
just take this as my recommendation to read it and get back to me later, i
guess). my partner recommended it to me as topical reading for all the thoughts
i've had about the internet, computers, and tildeverse recently.

sometimes it's suddenly 2am and i didn't notice because i've been blasting
music through my headphones, sipping whiskey, pounding on a keyboard. i notice
that my fingers are sluggish over the keys, and that sometimes a blink lasts
for minutes at a time while little packets of data are pushed out of my
machine.

go to bed, ~endo.
