a new day of feelings. mostly, i'm excited that a lot of people are excited
about this project of mine. i'm hella overwhelmed with work this week, but i
deal with that by having a project on the side that i am highly unlikely to run
out of things to worry over.

i'm happy there are people in the world, and i'm happy that people talk to each
other and learn and grow and become better versions of themselves. i'm having a
great day of feeling like there's no limit to my optimism and good vibes. this
isn't always the case for me, so i try extra hard to acknowledge it when i
notice it.
