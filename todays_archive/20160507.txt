i have all these bug reports building up! i'm excited people are using ttbp and
i'm also looking forward to developing and growing this program with the help
of the community. i've never done this before. i'm so grateful and surprised by
this. thanks for being here, everyone!

my headspace has been up and down a lot recently. i'm busy, and nervous, and
anxious, and i have a lot of things hanging vaguely in the future. it's taking
a lot of effort to maintain an even keel, to remember what i'm doing and why
i'm here.

i have three tattoos: a reminder to check for handedness, a suggestion to not
get too attached to objects, and an assertion that things will not always be
this way. i'm doing my best to maintain neutral ground. i'm doing my best to
provide a blank space for things to grow.

nothing happens in a vacuum.
