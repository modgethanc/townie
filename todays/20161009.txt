i spent all day in my pjs, which happens about once a month for me. i did
laundry and i wrote a paper and drew a tapir and cooked some food and ate it
and put the rest of it away. i thought my 8 year old eeepc was finally going to
fall over because of persistent i/o errors, but the drive recovered on a
reboot. i put away some clutter in my pocket studio and listened to a lot of
music. i closed my chotchkies window because it was chilly. i can feel winter
creeping in, and it feels good.
