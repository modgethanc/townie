im thumbtyping this over my slow friday morning coffee. i mostly listen to the
water pump running my neighbors koi pond, and the rough garble of an old
workvan trying to start up.

when its this overcast out, i lose track of the time passing. i want to start
ticking off tasks, but i cant quite bear to break the silence of having the
house to myself.

planes keep passing overhead while my stomach gurgles. i dont know where to go
from today, but tomorrow will roll in whether i want it to or not.

everything is narssicism. i dress to be seen, speak to be heard. there is
always the inevitable human desire to matter and feel valued. no one wants to
live in vain.
