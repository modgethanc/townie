i'm in a lot of pretty raw pain. it's bitter and quiet in here, where i'm
reminding myself to be patient and calm and to not lash out or assume ill will
of people who might not realize they're hurting me or others.

i'm always working on being the best person i can be. nothing has changed. but
now i can think more clearly about what's important to me, and what problems
there are for me to work on.

i still trust and believe that people can be good. i'm surrounded by love and
affirming compassion, and this gives me hope.
