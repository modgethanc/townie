i'm still not around here much; life's been a whirlwind of things. some of it
is strange, some of it is good, some of it is draining. the days turn. people
move on.

i'm still so excited and pleased that the feels engine keeps churning. i feel a
little bad that i've lost a bunch of momentum on development, but it seems to
still be mostly functional. i'm honored that y'all are using it!! also, big
love to ~sanqui for catching a bug and sending in a PR; i'm not sure i would
have picked that up myself so quickly.

please continue to keep bashing on this machine for as long as it's working for
you <3
