on my list:
  * learn more about using github by dumping all my ttbp production notes into
    github issues
  * learn about unit testing
  * write up an essay about developing and using ttbp for the zine

i've stubbed out all the points i want to cover with my ttbp essay, it's mostly
a matter of filling in the gaps and actually punching it into a readable
format. i've been feeling really good about my writing lately!
