have been having a hard time writing paragraphs or sentences and i'm saving
all that mana for a paper due this weekend.

i'm getting better at bullet pointing out things i want to write. it's a bit
lie doing a pencil undersketch before laying down ink. some days i'm good at
sketch and some days i'm good at ink, so i'm trying to recognize those modes
to better take advantage of them.

the hard drive on my 2008 era eeepc is probably actually toast. i'm doing my
paper on an external flash card so i'm less likely to lose progress. guess i
should really rehab my spare adopted machine soon!
