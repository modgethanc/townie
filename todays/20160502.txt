don't forget:
<ul>
<li>#tags for ttbp</li>
<li>entry filename validation</li>
</ul>

i'm having some serious deadjournal-era nostalgia. can we have copy-paste
surveys and shit like that again? 'current mood', 'current music', etc. oh god.

i'm not yet fond of the name 'ttbp', which was mostly a placeholder (the
placeholder prior to that was 'tlog', some of which is still leftover in the
stylesheets), although i do like that it looks kind of like 'http'.
