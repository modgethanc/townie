traveling a lot. traveling, doodling, thinking.

i'm always happy to see new posts on ttbp, and i'm always happy that people are
dumping words here, and i'm always happy that people are reading them.

i've been stalled on working on the program because it kind of hit most of my
goals for being stable and usable, and i haven't felt very motivated to pick at
the new features i've been thinking about. it's nice to step back and just use
it, flicking words, marinating in feels. maybe i'll pick it up later, when i
feel like nosing through again.

the days tick by. the sun warms and scorches, but i already feel the daylight
starting to slip away. more and more, i'm becoming aware of the endless swell
and fade of the seasons; i think about time as seasons more than months, now.
i've seen enough to start thinking about decades rather than years. it hasn't
been that many for me. i'm hoping for many more.

i don't know what kind of person i am, or what kind i will become. i think i'm
still excited to work on that. yeah. i think i am.

i'm pretty sleepy.
