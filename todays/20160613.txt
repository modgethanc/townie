    a limerick oughn't be hard
    for any accomplished bard
    just make up a rhyme
    and ask for a dime
    and then buy yourself a reward

    --

    we're riding the feels machine
    it's complex and simple to mean
    whatever you want
    with feelings to haunt
    and memories come in between

    --

    a ghost isn't always a scare
    at most it's a little bit there
    some whispering words
    might only be birds
    as opposed to a voice in thin air
