i voted today. it made me feel good and confident and grateful; i texted my
parents afterwards to thank them for working hard to make it here and have a
life here so that i could grow up and participate in a system that lets me have
a more meaningful say in my government than they ever had.

i hope everyone can be strong and brave and do what they think is right.
