today is pretty bad feels. i'm letting things get to me, and angry that they're
getting to me, and frustrated that i have to work this hard to keep things from
getting to me, and sad that i do not think there is a forseeable change.

i'm crawling up the front end of a cold and feeling tired and unproductive.

i'm scared and confused.

i'm reminding myself of how to keep calm and level.
