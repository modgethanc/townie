hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite.

unproductive, quietly wasting each moment away.

--

i am an endless stream of somewhat disconnected instances of consciousness.
occasionally, i stand and look at myself and realize i am someone different. i
fantasize constantly. i fantasize. i dream of stepping away and i tick off
boxes thinking about what sort of person i could be, rather than examining the
sort of person i am.

--

the sky goes on forever. i watch the clouds rise.

--

'what are you so afraid of?' i demand.

'i wish i wasn't too afraid to say,' i answer.

--

thank you. thank you. always, thank you. are you there? if not, i wouldn't
know.

--

i'm afraid i'll leave this world before i've finished extruding my brain into
it. i wish i didn't need to sleep.

--

i remember one time the person who ran a page i was submitting to deleted a
bunch of my submissions and told me to 'calm down' because 'you're like
scribble scribble POST scribble scribble POST and i really want it to be like
less shitty than that here' and i never posted there again.

--

i scribble things down because i can't remember things on the fly and this way
i can thumb through them later. i don't know how much of what i say is lies.
