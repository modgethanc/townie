i have these outbursts of sudden defensiveness, panic, worry, and then i lash
out at everyone around me. in retrospect, they always make me feel stupid and
weak-willed; i'm trying to learn to recognize when that's happening, and
redirect my thoughts towards remembering that most people are not in my head,
and most people are not deliberately trying to provoke me.

it's hard. i can't figure out how much of this is me and how much of this is
the rest of the world.

i can be spiteful, vengeful, and hold grudges. i can stubbornly refuse to let
go of things; i can wholly fail to interpret interactions as anything other
than antagonizing.

thus is part of many abilities of humans. we can only perceive the world from
our position inside of our heads, and in our attempts to interact with the
world, it is inevitable that we are self-centric.

that doesn't mean this is bad. that doesn't mean this is good.
