take a long, deep breath. feel it slide into your chest, pushing against its
bounds. inhale until it hurts. hold it there, a fluttering bird inside your
ribs, until you see stars. hold it tight. let the panic rise inside of you,
swelling until it competes for the space that breath is desperately trying to
escape.

let it go. if you love something, you have to let it go. you cannot keep it
inside you forever.

you can take another breath. you can let that one out. you can take another one
in. and then release that.

take a long, deep breath. let it fill your body. let your blood extract what it
needs. release what you cannot absorb.

take a long, deep breath. give yourself permission to let it go.

take a long, deep breath. release it before you are ready.

take a long, deep breath. let it go.
