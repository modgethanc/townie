<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Chaotic Neutral</b> A chaotic neutral character
follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He values his own
liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom. He avoids authority,
resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character
does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy.
To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to
liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself
suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is
not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.
Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents true
freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal. However,
chaotic neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to eliminate all
authority, harmony, and order in society.<br>

<u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races.
Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them
physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress,
sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.

<u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Wizards</b> are arcane spellcasters who
depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a
talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle,
wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise,
they are vulnerable. The wizard's strength is her spells, everything else is
secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience,
and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard
learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are
improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar- a small, magical,
animal companion that serves her. With a high Intelligence, wizards are capable
of casting very high levels of spells.

<u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Sorcerers</b> are arcane spellcasters who
manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious
discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that
they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire
them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no
need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards,
sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their
powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through,
they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple
weapons. Charisma is very important for sorcerers; the higher their value in
this ability, the higher the spell level they can cast.
