secret option: this is a feature under development, but if you have blog
publishing turned on, you can selectively mark certain days to not show up on
your public_html; add a file called `nopub` under your `.ttbp/config` and put
the filenames you don't want published on separate lines.

(feel free to reference `~endorphant/.ttbp/config/nopub` if you're confused!)

i'll add a function to do this from the main program sometime soon!

so sleepy. dealing with allergy season by spending as much time as humanly
possible out pushing my face through the air.

i haven't been sleeping very well, and it's the season of work off a hangover
just in time to go out for drinks again. a lot of people i know are leaving
town, and i'm spending a bunch of time making sure they get good send offs.
maybe i'm not even joking when i say i'm getting a little old for this.

i can't keep track of what i need to do anymore so i just have a growing pile
of post-its on the wall over my desk that i'm only allowed to remove if i clear
everything from one.
