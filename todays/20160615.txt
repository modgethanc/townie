this summer feels scary and bad all of a sudden, and i'm not really sure what
to do with it.

i'm trying to do well at lining up things to do, leaving myself low hanging
fruit, giving myself permission to be a useless layabout once in a while, but
whenever i turn the corner i find myself standing in a mist of unrelenting
dread.

the air is thick and warm. i think i'm doing the best i can whenever i'm doing
it. i have ups and downs. i crash and i soar and i am a thinking, feeling
human.

you will not always feel like this.
