repeat to yourself that everything works out fine at some point

repeat to yourself

breathing slowly and carefully.

my calves ache and my eyes are dry and my shoulders creak and i know it's
because i love myself and work hard to become the best version of myself that i
can.

i'm slowly following through on promises.

slowly.

i don't always move very quickly.

--

one of those days when i compulsively open and close tabs. my helmet and jacket
are already on but i cannot peel myself away from the keyboard. i'm tapping my
feet, anxious to get home. i open my email again. i refresh a tab. i close this
tab. i power off the monitor, and open the laptop next to me.

everything will be okay.
