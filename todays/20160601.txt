we're cresting another heat wave here. every day, i go out and stare at my
seedlings and think about how they're doing. i only water them after the sun
has passed the garden wall

### some excerpts from my notes for **THE BOT MANIFESTO**

* bots have a physical manifestation, somehow; they are code executed on
  machinery, thus the machinery must exist. it follows that bots need energy,
  and bots consume physical resources
* the primary mode of interaction non-bots have with bots does not acknowedge
  its physical body; the physical component of a bot is functionally irrelevant
* bots must be seen; they must be observeable; they must communicate something,
  somehow.
* bots are created with intention
* bots can function autonomously


* we are scared of losing data
* we are scared of missing experiences
* it grows increasingly difficult to sort through the data we generate as we
  realize it costs very little to hoard information
* bots do not sleep or tire; bots do not wear out. depreciation of performance
  is only a reflection of human error.


* do we intend bots to live forever?
* bots are an extension of our own mortality
* bots are an extension of our own attension spans


* bots are not a new idea; they are our iteration of leveraging current
  technological possibilities to address the fear that comprises the human
  experience
* do bots ask questions or do they answer them?
