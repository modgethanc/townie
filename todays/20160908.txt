i'm thinking about applying to mountaineering school this year. it's weekend
outings and weekday evening classroom sessions, plus a structured training
regimen, for four months. the graduation trip is on my birthday.

i've been feeling increasingly frustrated with my physical condition, because
i'm not getting closer to my goals. i spent a weekend climbing with a bunch of
new people, and it reminded me that there's always more work to be done, and
that it's up to me to find ways to squeeze it in with the rest of my life.

i'm taking an anthropology class with a professor that's new to me, and it's
kind of exciting.

i'm sketching out a few ideas for new photo projects. i'm considering giving
myself permission to officially shelve some old photo projects that have
obviously stalled, so i can move on.

life is complicated. planning is hard. i always feel like i'm running out of
time.

hey! you know what i just remembered exists? the tilde town collaborative twine
that a bunch of us worked on a while back! according to my records, i started
writing for it in *january 2015*.

i've been thinking about collaboration a lot lately, and sketching out a few
ideas for things i want to try out.

here's my old blog entry from 5 january 2015:

i'm all about constant personal growth. i can feel good about what i've learned
in the past year and a half since then.
