there's a space between all of us. there's a point at which one human
physically ends, and another begins. that space is occupied by thoughts,
connections, dreams, emotions. we love things and we hate things and we desire
things and we cannot help but compare ourselves to things we perceive as
different because, inevitably, all things that are not us are different.

where do you end and where does someone else begin? there's only the sense that
that separation exists, but i do not know where i would draw that line.
