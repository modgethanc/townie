constantly swinging up and down, between feeling crushed and drained to the
core and feeling full of strength and love and energy. i'm riding out the lows
and using the highs to set myself up to keep momentum going. it takes time to
adjust. it takes time to adjust. it takes time to adjust.

my dogsittee is a devoted, attentive animal, and it's so wonderful to have her
at my feet.

i'm evaluating my priorities, constantly.
