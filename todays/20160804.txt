i've been all over the place for the past few weeks. i have a brief pause here
before i hit the road again, i think. sometimes, i'm bad at keeping up with
things. the escapist desire runs high; there is hardly enough time for me to
fully become the person i want to be.

i'll do my best.

i visited my parents at their new home for the first time; they seem happy. a
little stressed and confused, but for the greater good. they'll always be kind
of batty, and they'll always treat me like a child, and we're learning to live
with that.

everything feels very different right now.
