i'm feeling all this vague panic about not getting things done. i feel horrible
talking about things or saying things or making plans and then just lying down
in a puddle of blob instead of working on them. i make to do lists to remember
what i wanted to achieve and it just turns into another wall of post-its that
slowly drift to the floor when the adhesive dries out. i clear old notes and
find all the dreams i forgot about, and then i don't even remember why i cared
about any of it.

i worry that i'm setting bad precedents for myself. i'm terrified that when i
give myself permission to have bad days, i'm also giving myself slack to pull
up any number of excuses. i used to think that my child self would be proud of
the person i've become, but now the adult self is disappointed in the person
i'm growing into.

'be more patient,' i tell myself. 'be forgiving and kind, and love people. help
them learn about their mistakes, and learn from their mistakes.'

can you do this for yourself, too? or do you do this as a projection of your
inability to do this for yourself?

i'm just practicing on other people, so i can do better inside my own head.

everything is inside my own head. nobody lives in here except for me.
