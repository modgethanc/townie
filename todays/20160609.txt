throwing stuff on my motorcycle gonna take off for the weekend always feel
nervous and excited when i do this

i spend a lot of time thinking the thought 'if this kills me right now i'll be
okay with it'; i don't expect to get killed but i want to know that it'll be
okay if it happens to be my time to go

i've still got a lot of stuff to do but it's important that i do things that
terrify me all the time so i'm gonna do that

i love everything all the time <3
